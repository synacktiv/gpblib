## GPBLib

GPBLib contains the common code used by the [GroupPolicyBackdoor](https://github.com/synacktiv/GroupPolicyBackdoor), [OUned](https://github.com/synacktiv/OUned) and [GPOddity](https://github.com/synacktiv/GPOddity) projects for GPO manipulations.

The migration of the tools to the use of the present library is still in progress.
